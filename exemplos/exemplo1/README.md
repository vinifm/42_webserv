# Webserv
This project is about writing a [HTTP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server), your own version of [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Apache](https://apache.org/) or [Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/).

### What is Webserv?
Webserv is a group project at [42](42sp.org.br) which requires us to build a [HTTP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) using [I/O Multiplexing](https://notes.shichao.io/unp/ch6/) built on top of a [event loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20event,or%20messages%20in%20a%20program.).

In the mandatory part, we start the server by reading a [configuration file](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/) that can be based on [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), containing information like hostname(ip/port), servername, index file, directory listing, URL redirect, location(vhost path) and some other settings. It is forbidden to use [fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) to create new [non-CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) processes or spawn [threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) (threads are not available in [C++98](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)).

For the [I/O Multiplexing](https://notes.shichao.io/unp/ch6/), ie informing the [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) that we want to be notified if there is a change in a previously specified list of [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor); we can use [select](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html), [poll](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html), [epoll](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html) or [kqueue](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&sektion=2). All socket reads or writes must pass through [poll()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html) or equivalent, ensuring high server availability, respecting the [event loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20event,or%20messages%20in%20a%20program.).

[HTTP requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) are read, parsed, processed and sent to a [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) if configured in the [configuration file](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/basic-functionality/managing-configuration-files/) and finally a [HTTP response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is returned to the client with [headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers), [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body) and correct [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

For the bonus we have to support [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie), [session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session) management and handle multiple [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface).
